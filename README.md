# Masala Dosa Vegetarian Restaurant

my favorite Indian restaurant didn’t have an interactive website to showcase their yummy lineup and services so i built one! made with React and Next.js.

goal was to make the restaurant's information (deals, menu items) easier to browse so more customers are compelled to visit, order online, and enjoy good food.

check out the revamped website at: https://masala-dosa-website.vercel.app/

look through the restaurant’s special deals, full menu, and contact information. and please support the restaurant by visiting or ordering online! 

my favorite menu items / recommendations: 
- benne podi dosa
- nool parotta with salna / bun parotta with salna
- filter coffee 

check out the original website at: https://www.masaladosa.us/ 

next steps:
currently collaborating with the restaurant to integrate the Clover API so that menu updates made by staff automatically reflect on the website in real time.
