# Masala Dosa Vegetarian Restaurant Website

## Timeline
August 2025 - ongoing

## Context
Masala Dosa has been my family’s favorite restaurant this summer, and I noticed their original website lacked interactivity and didn’t fully capture their menu or offerings. To address this, I built a modern, user-friendly version of their website using React and Next.js, making the information easier to browse. This project not only supported the restaurant but also gave me the opportunity to strengthen my frontend development skills and gain hands-on experience with modern frameworks. I wanted my practice to go beyond tutorials and create a real-world application with meaningful context and tangible impact.

## Objective
* Make the restaurant’s information (menu items, special deals, and contact details) more accessible and visually engaging.
* Improve customer experience and encourage more online orders.
* Celebrate Masala Dosa’s South Indian cuisine with a modern, digital presence so more customers are compelled to visit and enjoy good food.

## Process

**Design Approach:**
* Researched different fast food and Indian restaurant websites to identify common practices and areas for improvement.
* Prototyped ideas in Figma to explore different layouts and features.
* Prioritized clean navigation, easy menu access, and highlighting special offers.
* Implemented a responsive layout optimized for both desktop and mobile.

**Tech Stack:** Built with React and Next.js, deployed on Vercel.

**Next Steps:**
* Finalizing the website design and features in collaboration with the restaurant.
* Integrating the Clover API, which will allow staff updates to the menu to automatically sync in real time on the website.
* Future plans: online ordering and customer reviews.
